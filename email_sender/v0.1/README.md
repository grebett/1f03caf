# Mailjet templating language console tool

This email sender tool is to be used in your console.

It has been built to help you test Mailjet's templating language and MJML.

## Prerequisites

First of all, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (this tool has been tested for versions >= v7.2.1).

You should have also a [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) account and a [valid API key](https://app.mailjet.com/support/what-are-the-api-key-and-secret-keys-how-should-i-use-them,109.htm). If you're not a client yet, you can [subscribe for a free account](https://app.mailjet.com/signup) (and send immediately up to 6000 free emails a month!). __Warning:__ don't use a disposable email address (gmail, yahoo, etc included), as you'll be likely to be blocked by our anti-spammer policy.

Finally, you'll need an access to the [MJML API](https://mjml.io/api), actually in [open beta](https://mjml.io/api).

## Installation

Download this tool directly or clone the parent directory.

To install dependencies, run: `npm install`

## Configuration

This tool uses two sets of API keys (_Send API_ and _MJML API_). You must provide the tool with a `.credentials` file, that contains the following environment variables:

```sh
MAILJET_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MAILJET_API_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MJML_APPLICATION_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MJML_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## About your templates

A template is composed of two files, one for MJML, and the other to declare templating language's variables data.

These files must be created in a specific directory, matching the following pattern: `./templates/template-name`.

Your MJML file must be named `index.mjml`.

Your JSON variables file must be named `variables.json`.

## Run the tool

To run the tool, you can use the `start` script, with your template name as the single argument. For instance: `npm start template-name`

## Testing

If you want to modify this tool, we've provided you with a very succinct test suite (using [chai](chaijs.com) and [mocha](mochajs.org)). Feel free to improve it or write your own.

To run it, simply hit: `npm run test`
